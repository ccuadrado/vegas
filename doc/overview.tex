\section{Problem Statement}

Our project aims to create a virtual file system code-named VegasFS. Vegas will
implement an adapter to the twitter online messaging service. By making use of
REST Principals and the FuSE project Vegas will allow a user should be able to
mount the system to an arbitrary part of the file space they have appropriate
permissions for. Then, using the standard tools for browsing files provided by
the operating system---both command line and GUI---they will be able to access
several different areas of the twitter service.

The specific parts of the api that can be accessed are described in more detail
in the section on project requirements below.
