## Dependencies

Vegas requires both Ruby and Fuse to run. It has been tested on Mac OS X with MacFUSE.

You can install ruby by downloading the source code for [ruby
1.8.7](http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p352.tar.gz). Ruby's
packaging system, RubyGems, should be installed as well. It can be obtained
[here](http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.8.5.tgz).

MacFUSE can be downloaded [here](http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/downloads/detail?name=MacFUSE-2.0.3%2C2.dmg&can=2&q=).

## Installation

There is no install procedure for Vegas at this time, but you can run it
directly out of the source directory.

First, ensure that you have bundler installed:

    $ gem install bundler

All other ruby depenencies can then be installed with the bundle command.

    $ bundle install

## Running

In depth instructions are available in the project document, but in short, you
first create the directory you want to mount vegas to

    $ mkdir t

then mount it with the vegas script:

    $ ruby -rubygems -Ilib bin/vegas mount t

You can then access the system through the normal command line tools:

    $ cat t/user/agentjose1.txt
